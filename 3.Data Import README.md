Assignment A:

Learning Objectives - 
* read and write Excel files
* shape data

Tasks - 
  1. Loading the data file into a data frame.
  2. The seasons are not standardized and would make analysis difficult. Six levels of seasons: Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring, YearRound, 
  HalfYear are to be created and further to be converted each provided season in the Season1Date column to one of the season levels. 
  Reasonable rules are to be determined, for example, June to August would be Summer, while 5/1 to 10/30 would be HalfYear.
  3. Writing a retrieval function acceptsWIC() that allows a data scientist to find which markets accept WIC. The function should output 
  a data frame containing only the markets that accept WIC. 

The data file " 2013 Geographic Coordinate Spreadsheet for U S Farmers Markets 8'3'1013 " is needed for this assignment.

Assignment B:

Learning Objectives - 
* read and parse XML
* retrieve data from XML

Tasks - 
  1. Loading the XML document at the URL ( http://www.xmldatasets.net/temp/179681356453762.xml ) directly into a data frame.
  2. Writing a fu nction senatorName() that returns the names of the senators for a given state, i.e., the function takes a state as 
  an argument and returns the names of the senators for that state in a vector.
  3. Writing a function s enatorPhone() that returns the phone number for a given senator. The function should take the first and last 
  name of the senator as an argument, parse the name, search for a match in the data frame and return the phone number for that senator.
  Be sure to call your functions to test that it works. Use local variables only and pass any information your function needs as 
  parameters.

Assignment C:

Learning Objectives - 
* read and parse XML
* retrieve data from XML

Tasks - 
  1. Loading and then parse the XML document at the URL ( http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/xmldatasets/data/auctions/ebay.xml ) 
  using xmlTreeParse() . The data sets contains bidding information about items on eBay.
  Create any intermediate data objects as deemed necessary to write a function named moreFiveBids() to answer the following question: 
  how many auctions had more than 5 bids? Use the function to output the answer.
  2. Consider the data set on trades during a single day for ESZ13 futures trades at the URL 
  http://www.barchartmarketdata.com/datasamples/getHistory15.xml .
  After loading the data, write and use the following functions to answer these retrieval queries:
    a. highestClosingPrice() answers the question: what was the highest closing price for the security?
    b. totalVolume() answers the question: what was the total volume traded?
    c. averageVolume() answers the question: what was the average trading volume during each HOUR of the trading day? The function 
    should place the result into a data frame containing the hour and average trading volume for that hour.

Assignment D:

Learning Objectives - 
* read and parse text files

Tasks - 
  1. Loading IMDB movie listing from the file movies.list.gz . Note that the file is compressed so you need to figure out how to 
  uncompress it in R. Inspect the file and determine how to best load it this is not an XML file and requires custom string parsing.
  2. Parsing the data. Identification all the fields and their meanings within the file is important. Place the data into a data frame 
  suitable for further analysis.
  3. Comment your code where I identify the movie rows that are part of your result set.
  4. The result set should only contain movie title and movie release year. The result set should NOT include rows for TV shows. 
  Identification of the movies within the data file (a special marking field or some other indication).
 
 The data file for this assignment is movies.list.gz.

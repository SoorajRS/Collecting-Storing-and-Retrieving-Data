Learning Objectives - 
* install the MongoDB server
* insert data into MongoDB
* fetch data from MongoDB

Tasks - 

A. Install the MongoDB server on your system. Follow the stepbystep Guide to Install MongoDB from the official website as listed below 
  or follow the instructions in Chapter 14 of the book.
    1. Installation on MacOS https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/installmongodbonosx/
    2. Installation on Windows https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/installmongodbonwindows/
    3. Installation on Ubuntu https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/installmongodbonubuntu/

B. Insert the Bird Strikes.csv file into MongoDB and use the export command to display the inserted file. Note : Remember to reshape 
  the data by removing the dots (periods) from the column names before inserting the data into MongoDB.
  For removing the dots I physically removed spaces and special characters in the csv file. However, it can be done with scripting too.

C. Perform the following fetch operations:
    1. Fetch the unique airport names from the database
    2. Count the nu number of records where originState equals “New Jersey”
    3. Fetch the data with conditionsPrecipitation being fog and sort the data in descending order of recordId.
    4. Fetch only the following columns for aircraftAirlineOperator:“AMERICAN AIRLINES” and “CONTINENTAL AIRLINES”
      * recordId
      * originState
      * aircraftAirlineOperator
      * airportName

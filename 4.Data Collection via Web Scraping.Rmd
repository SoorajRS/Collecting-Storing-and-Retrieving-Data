## Assignment 6A - Web Scraping

# Question 1
3 web scraping toolkits are - "rvest", "RCurl and XML" & "import.io"

Selecting the website - when searced for restaurants in Yellow Pages website
```{r}
url <- "http://www.yellowpages.com/search?search_terms=restaurant&geo_location_terms=Boston%2C+MA"
```
I am using this website to extract information like name and phone number of the restaurants in Boston area, in a tabukar form.

# Question 2
[A] rvest
```{r}
rm(list=ls())

library(rvest)
library(xml2)
library(stringr)

s <- read_html(url) #url into html
s %>% html_nodes("business-name") %>% html_text() #selecting business name
n <- s %>% html_nodes("business-name") %>% html_text()
n <- trimws(b)

s %>% html_nodes("phones") %>% html_text() #selecting phone numbers
p <- s %>% html_nodes("phones") %>% html_text()%>% str_trim()

yprv <- cbind(n,p) #web data into data frame
head(yprv) #brief view of the data
```

[B] RCurl and XML package
```{r}
library(XML)
library(bitops)
library(RCurl)

url <- "http://www.yellowpages.com/search?search_terms=restaurant&geo_location_terms=Boston%2C+MA"
url <- getURL(url)
url <- htmlParse(url) #htmlparse for selecting nodes

bname <- getNodeSet(url,'//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat( "
", \"business-name", " " ))]//span/text()') #exttracting business name
bname <- sapply(name, xmlValue) #converting to character value

ph <- getNodeSet(url,'//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat(
" ", "phones", " " ))]/text()')
ph <- sapply(phone2,xmlValue)
ph <- trimws(phone2,which = c("both"))
yprc <- cbind(bname,ph) #combining data into data frame
head(yprc)
```

[C] import.io

# Question 3
Comments after using the web scrapers

1) import.io was the easiest to collect information without writing any script. Entire information was available including rec=views, etc. However, I was able to use it on trail basis. Hence, to use it extensivlely I might have to pay for it. Other two tools do not show this problem.

2) In terms of coding RCurl seemed more complex than rvest. Codes using rvest are easier to read too. Also conversion to dataframe is easier.

Easiest to use -> import.io
Recommended to use -> rvest

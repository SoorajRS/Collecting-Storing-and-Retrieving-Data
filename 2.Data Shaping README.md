Assignment A:

Learning Objectives - 
* read and write CSV files
* load and convert dates
* calculate with dates

Tasks - 
  1. Loading the data file "Acquisitions" into an appropriate data object of my choice. 
  The files contains dates and firms into which an investment was made.
  2. Writing a function called leastInvInterval() that finds the smallest interval between successive investments.
  
The data file is Acquisitions.csv

Assignment B:

Learning Objectives - 
* read and write CSV files
* load and convert dates
* calculate with dates
* summarize date data

Tasks - 
  1. Loading the data file "BirdStrikes" into an appropriate data object of my choice. Also finding out how many bird strikes did not 
  have a “Reported: Date” assigned, i.e., for wherethere is no value for " Reported: Date".
  2. Writing a function to calculate which year had the most bird strikes. 
  3. Finding out how many bird strikes were there for each year & Place the result into a data frame.
  4. Writing a function that calculates the number of birds strikes per airline and then put those results into a dataframe called 
  AirlineStrikes. Writing another function that accepts the dataframe AirlineStrikes as an argument, and returns the airline that has 
  the most bird strikes.
  5. Comment on the time and space complexity of the functions. What would happen if the data set were 2x, 10x, 100x, 1000x bigger than 
  it is now? How would that affect memory use and run time of your code? Express complexity estimate using bigO notation. 
  6. Choosing one of my functions and use system.time() to measure the execution time for the original sized data, 2 times the original 
  size and 4 times the original size by duplicating the data set. Verify whether the measured results match your expected results reported 
  in answer 5.

The data file is Birdstrikes.csv

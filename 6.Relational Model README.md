Learning Objectives - 
* design a relational data storage structure
* normalize data
* create a visual data model

Tasks - 
Revisit the Bird Strike data set that we previously worked with. The data file contains the following data fields 
(ignore any additional fields in the file and limit your database to these):
* Aircraft Type
* Airport Name
* Altitude
* Aircraft: Make/Model
* Wildlife
* Effect: Impact to Flight
* Effect: Other
* Location
* Flight Number
* Flight Date
* Record ID
* Effect: Indicate Damage
* Aircraft: Number of Engines
* Airline/Operator
* Origin State
* When: Phase of Flight
* Conditions: Precipitation
* Remains of Wildlife Collected?
* Remarks
* Reported: Date
* Wildlife: Size
* Conditions: Sky
* Wildlife: Species
* When
* Pilot Warned of Bird Strikes
* Cost: Aircraft Time Out
* Cost: Repair
* Feet above Ground
* Speed

Note that not all fields have values. You need to determine if that means the data is not available because it is unknown or because it 
does not apply, i.e., do you have an optional field? That determines whe ther you allow null values.

Design a normalized (at least 3NF) relational data model that has minimal redundancy. Createas many tables as you need. Decide on 
primary and foreign keys and add new ID fields as required. Construct a visual model using LucidChart an online visual modeling tool 
(this is built into Google Docs or available as a standalone webbased tool).
